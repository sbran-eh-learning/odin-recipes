            <!--I had to go back and look at the original less on images to make sure that I done this one right. Here is the example that was used on the lesson  <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">-->
        
        <h2>Candace Branham's baked chili cheese dogs!</h2>
        <p>These are a staple around the Branham house ever since Candace first tested out the recipe a couple of years back. We have experimented with a few different variations but this is the original. It's hard to improve on perfection. </p> <br>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <uL>
                <li>Hotdog buns</li>
                <li>100% Beef hotdogs</li>
                <li>Beenless chili</li>
                <li>Fritos mild cheddar cheese dip</li>
                <li>OPTIONAL - Lee's coleslaw </li>
            </uL> <br>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat oven to 375Â° F</li>
                <li>Place the hotdogs only (no buns) into the pre-heated oven for about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the pan and take the hotdogs off.</li>
                <li>Lay the buns out on the heated pan and add the hotdogs, chili, cheddar cheese, and finish off with a final layer of chili.</li>
                <li>Place the pan back into the over and cook until chili is heated and the chese is good and melted (approximately 4-5 minutes).</li>
                <li>Plate the hotdogs and add on some Lee's coleslaw if you want or you could just enjoy slightly sub par hotdogs if you wish.</li>
            </ol>
