        <!--I don't know Candace's recipe so I borrowed this one from https://www.verybestbaking.com/libbys/recipes/libby-s-pumpkin-roll/-->
        <h2>Candace Branham's holiday time pumpkin roll!</h2>
            <p>This has became a staple at our house around Christmas time. It was one of the first things Candace fixed for me and has added more then a couple of lbs on me since then. </p> <br>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar to sprinkle on the towel</li>
                <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 Large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2/3 cup LIBBY's 100% pure pumpkin</li>
                <li>1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup powdered sugar, sifted</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter softened</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>powdered sugar for decoration</li>
            </ul> <br>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375° F. Grease 15 x 10-inch jelly-roll pan; line with wax paper. Grease and flour paper. Sprinkle a thin, cotton kitchen towel with 1/4 cup powdered sugar.</li>
                <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt in small bowl. Beat eggs and granulated sugar in large mixer bowl until thick. Beat in pumpkin. Stir in flour mixture. Spread evenly into prepared pan. Sprinkle with nuts.</li>
                <li>Bake for 13 to 15 minutes or until top of cake springs back when touched. (If using a dark-colored pan, begin checking for doneness at 11 minutes.) Immediately loosen and turn cake onto prepared towel. Carefully peel off paper. Roll up cake and towel together, starting with narrow end. Cool on wire rack.</li>
                <li>Beat cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, butter and vanilla extract in small mixer bowl until smooth. Carefully unroll cake. Spread cream cheese mixture over cake. Reroll cake. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least one hour. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.</li>
                <li>Cooking Tip: Be sure to put enough powdered sugar on the towel when rolling up the cake so it will not stick.</li>
            </ol>
